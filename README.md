# Smart-Parking
In this project we will build an application, the user will be able to book a parking slot in Sharda University. After the log in procedure, the user will select the arrival time and book a slot by viewing the available parking slots in the form of a map. After booking the slot, he pays for the booking through a credit based system. The user has an option to get a turn by turn directed map from his start point to the assigned parking slot through a GPS system. After reaching the campus, the GPS verifies the possession and updates the slot map. While the user is leaving the slot, the GPS confirms the exit and updates the particular slot status as free.
